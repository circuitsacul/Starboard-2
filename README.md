:warning: This repo is under constant, daily development, and I'm making breaking changes on a daily basis. Until I finish the basics of this bot, I will not include database migrations. I would highly recommend waiting until I finish (maybe a month) before trying to self-host this bot. :warning:

A complete rewrite of Starboard
